# Dequeue Data Structure using Circular Queue

## Overview

This repository provides an implementation of a **Dequeue** (Double-ended Queue) using a **circular queue**. A Dequeue allows insertion and deletion of elements from both the front and rear ends, making it a versatile data structure. By leveraging circular queue theory, we ensure optimal use of space and efficient element management.
